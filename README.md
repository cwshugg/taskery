# Android Automation!
This repository is where I store any useful profiles/tasks I've made in Tasker. They can be imported in the app by long-pressing on the "Profiles" or "Tasks" tab at the top of the screen. You'll have to have the .xml file on your device somewhere, so be sure to download these onto your device before you try it!
